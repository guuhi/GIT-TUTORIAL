git = version history of code, like version history of google docs

command line:
ls
cd

to setup git or create a version in a folder:
from commandline: - go to folder directory
                  - git innit 

some commands are in the pdf!

git status - to check the status, how many commits are there
git add [file/folder]
git add . - to add all that is in the cd (does not create a new version yet)

version = commit

git commmit -m ""
            m = message

git commit -m "" --amend - commit the changes but to the previous commit (when there is a mistake)

git log - to see the version history
commit d51f22c62b4803b4d011016afba0b2cbc6449262 (HEAD -> master)
